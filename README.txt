This is  a simple formula i make to calculate damage u dealted to a objective basing to a attack stat, critical chance and dmg, and objectives defense.
thos are files literaly copied from my godot project, i guess those files only can be executed in godot engine (3.2.2 or above)


sry for bad english, i recently discover that can be done whit less line and i'll use it to my rpg game that im trying to make.
i acept criticism

hope u have a nice day, and i took time to upload those files due to github problems
